## Introduction to HamGNN
The HamGNN model is an E(3) equivariant graph neural network designed for the purpose of training and predicting tight-binding (TB) Hamiltonians of molecules and solids. Currently, HamGNN can be used in common ab initio DFT software that is based on numerical atomic orbitals, such as OpenMX, Siesta, and Abacus. HamGNN supports predictions of SU(2) equivariant Hamiltonians with spin-orbit coupling effects. HamGNN not only achieves a high fidelity approximation of DFT but also enables transferable predictions across material structures, making it suitable for high-throughput electronic structure calculations and accelerating computations on large-scale systems.

## Requirements

The following environments and packages are required to use HamGNN:

### Python libraries
We recommend using the Python 3.9 interpreter. HamGNN needs the following python libraries:
- NumPy
- PyTorch = 1.11.0
- PyTorch Geometric = 2.0.4
- pytorch_lightning = 1.5.10
- e3nn = 0.5.0
- pymatgen
- TensorBoard
- tqdm
- scipy
- yaml

### OpenMX
HamGNN aims to fit the TB Hamiltonian generated by `OpenMX`. The user need to know the basic OpenMX parameters and how to use them properly. OpenMX can be downloaded from this [site](https://www.openmx-square.org/).

### openmx_postprocess
openmx_postprocess is a modified OpenMX package used for computing overlap matrices and other Hamiltonian matrices that can be calculated analytically. The data computed by openmx_postprocess will be stored in a binary file `overlap.scfout`. The installation and usage of openmx_postprocess is essentially the same as that of OpenMX. To install openmx_postprocess, you need to install the [GSL](https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/) library first.Then enter the openmx_postprocess directory and modify the following parameters in the makefile:
+ `GSL_lib`: The lib path of GSL
+ `GSL_include`: The include path of GSL
+ `MKLROOT`: The intel MKL path
+ `CMPLR_ROOT`: The path where the intel compiler is installed

After modifying the makefile, you can directly execute the make command to generate two executable programs, `openmx_postprocess` and `read_openmx`.

### read_openmx
read_openmx is a binary executable that can be used to export the matrices from the binary file overlap.scfout to a file called `HS.json`.

## Installation
Run the following command to install HamGNN:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/QuantumLab-ZY/HamGNN.git
cd HamGNN
python setup.py install
```

## Usage
### Preparation of Hamiltonian Training Data
First, generate a set of structure files (POSCAR or CIF files) using molecular dynamics or random perturbation. After setting the appropriate path parameters in the `poscar2openmx.py` file,
run `python poscar2openmx.py` to convert these structures into OpenMX's `.dat` file format. Run OpenMX to perform static calculations on these structure files and obtain the `.scfout` binary files, which store the Hamiltonian and overlap matrix information for each structure. These files serve as the target Hamiltonians during training. Next, run `openmx_postprocess` to process each structure and obtain the `overlap.scfout` file, which contains the Hamiltonian matrix H0 that is independent of the self-consistent charge density. If the constructed dataset is only used for prediction purposes and not for training (i.e., no target Hamiltonian is needed), run `openmx_postprocess` to obtain the `overlap.scfout` file merely. `openmx_postprocess` is executed similarly to OpenMX and supports MPI parallelism.

### Graph Data Conversion
After setting the appropriate path information in a `graph_data_gen.yaml` file, run `graph_data_gen --config graph_data_gen.yaml` to package the structural information and Hamiltonian data from all `.scfout` files into a single `graph_data.npz` file, which serves as the input data for the HamGNN network.

### HamGNN Network Training and Prediction
Prepare the `config.yaml` configuration file and set the network parameters, training parameters, and other details in this file. To run HamGNN, simply enter `HamGNN --config config.yaml`. Running `tensorboard --logdir train_dir` allows real-time monitoring of the training progress, where `train_dir` is the folder where HamGNN saves the training data, corresponding to the `train_dir` parameter in `config.yaml`. To enhance the transferability and prediction accuracy of the network, the training is divided into two steps. The first step involves training with only the loss value of the Hamiltonian in the loss function until the Hamiltonian training converges or the error reaches around 10^-5 Hartree, at which point the training can be stopped. Then, the band energy error is added to the loss function, and the network parameters obtained from the previous step are loaded for further training. After obtaining the final network parameters, the network can be used for prediction. First, convert the structures to be predicted into the input data format (`graph_data.npz`) for the network, following similar steps and procedures as preparing the training set. Then, in the `config.yaml` file, set the `checkpoint_path` to the path of the network parameter file and set the `stage` parameter to `test`. After configuring the parameters in `config.yaml`, running `HamGNN --config config.yaml` will perform the prediction. 
Several pre-trained models and the `config.yaml` file for the test examples are available on Zenodo (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8147631).

### Details of training for bands (The 2nd training/fine-tuning step)
When the training of the Hamiltonian matrix is completed in the first step, it is necessary to use the trained network weights to initialize the HamGNN network and start training for the energy bands. The parameters related to energy band training are as follows:
+ `checkpoint_path` parameter should be set to path of the weight file obtained after training on the Hamiltonian matrix in the first step.
+ Set `load_from_checkpoint` to True
+ `lr` should not be too large, it is recommended to use 0.0001.
+ In `losses_metrics` and `metrics`, remove the commented section for `band_energy`.
+ Set `calculate_band_energy` to True and specify the parameters `num_k`, `band_num`, and `k_path`.

After setting the above parameters, start the training again.

### Band Structure Calculation
Set the parameters in band_cal.yaml, mainly the path to the Hamiltonian data, then run `band_cal --config band_cal.yaml`

## The support for ABACUS software
The utilities to support ABACUS software have been uploaded in the `utils_abacus` directory. Users need to modify the parameters in the scripts within this directory. The code in `utils_abacus/abacus_H0_export` is derived from modifying the `abacus-postprocess` program based on ABACUS-3.5.3. Its function is similar to `openmx_postprocess`, used for exporting the Hamiltonian part `H0` independent of the self-consistent field (SCF) charge density. Compilation of `abacus-postprocess` is the same as the original ABACUS compilation.

`poscar2abacus.py` and `graph_data_gen_abacus.py` scripts are respectively utilized for generating ABACUS structure files and packaging the Hamiltonian matrix into the `graph_data.npz` file. Users can explore the usage of these tools independently. Later on, I'll briefly introduce the meanings of the parameters within these scripts.

## Diagonalizing Hamiltonian matrices for large scale systems
For crystal structures containing thousands of atoms, diagonalizing the Hamiltonian matrix using the serial `band_cal` script can be quite challenging. To address this, we've introduced a multi-core parallel `band_cal_parallel` script within band_cal_parallel directory.
### Installation
pip install mpitool-0.0.1-cp39-cp39-manylinux1_x86_64.whl

pip install band_cal_parallel-0.1.12-py3-none-any.whl

### Usage
In the Python environment with `band_cal_parallel` installed, execute the following command with multiple cpus to compute the band structure:
mpirun -np ncpus band_cal_parallel --config band_cal_parallel.yaml

##  How to set the options in config.yaml
The input parameters in config.yaml are divided into different modules, which mainly include `'setup'`, `'dataset_params'`, `'losses_metrics'`, `'optim_params'` and network-related parameters (`'HamGNN_pre'` and `'HamGNN_out'`).
