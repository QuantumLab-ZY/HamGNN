        Interpolates a path in reciprocal space between specified
        k-points.  In 2D or 3D the k-path can consist of several
        straight segments connecting high-symmetry points ("nodes"),
        and the results can be used to plot the bands along this path.
        
        The interpolated path that is returned contains as
        equidistant k-points as possible.
    
        :param kpts: Array of k-vectors in reciprocal space between
          which interpolated path should be constructed. These
          k-vectors must be given in reduced coordinates.  As a
          special case, in 1D k-space kpts may be a string:
    
          * *"full"*  -- Implies  *[ 0.0, 0.5, 1.0]*  (full BZ)
          * *"fullc"* -- Implies  *[-0.5, 0.0, 0.5]*  (full BZ, centered)
          * *"half"*  -- Implies  *[ 0.0, 0.5]*  (half BZ)
    
        :param nk: Total number of k-points to be used in making the plot.
        
        :param report: Optional parameter specifying whether printout
          is desired (default is True).

        :returns:

          * **k_vec** -- Array of (nearly) equidistant interpolated
            k-points. The distance between the points is calculated in
            the Cartesian frame, however coordinates themselves are
            given in dimensionless reduced coordinates!  This is done
            so that this array can be directly passed to function
            :func:`pythtb.tb_model.solve_all`.

          * **k_dist** -- Array giving accumulated k-distance to each
            k-point in the path.  Unlike array *k_vec* this one has
            dimensions! (Units are defined here so that for an
            one-dimensional crystal with lattice constant equal to for
            example *10* the length of the Brillouin zone would equal
            *1/10=0.1*.  In other words factors of :math:`2\pi` are
            absorbed into *k*.) This array can be used to plot path in
            the k-space so that the distances between the k-points in
            the plot are exact.

          * **k_node** -- Array giving accumulated k-distance to each
            node on the path in Cartesian coordinates.  This array is
            typically used to plot nodes (typically special points) on
            the path in k-space.
    
        Example usage::
    
          # Construct a path connecting four nodal points in k-space
          # Path will contain 401 k-points, roughly equally spaced
          path = [[0.0, 0.0], [0.0, 0.5], [0.5, 0.5], [0.0, 0.0]]
          (k_vec,k_dist,k_node) = my_model.k_path(path,401)
          # solve for eigenvalues on that path
          evals = tb.solve_all(k_vec)
          # then use evals, k_dist, and k_node to plot bandstructure
          # (see examples)
